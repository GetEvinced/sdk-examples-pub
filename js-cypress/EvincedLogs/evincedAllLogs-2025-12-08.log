                            Summary: Keyboard users must be able to navigate to all the interactive elements on the page.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element is missing the right tags or has incorrect tags. 
**Effect:** 
The element is excluded from the keyboard tab sequence and is therefore inaccessible to keyboard users. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use one of these approaches: 
* Approach 1 (recommended): Add a tag that shows the element's purpose. Interactive elements don't need anything extra because they are focusable by nature. 
* Approach 2: Add a `tabindex` attribute with the value of `0` to the element.

                            Severity: Critical
                            Summary: Anchor elements (<a>) must have an `href` attribute to be recognized as a link.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
 The <a> (anchor) element does not have an `href` attribute. 
**Effect:** 
Screen readers on Windows will read the element as plain text without indicating it is a link. On Mac OS, VoiceOver will still read the anchor as a link, even if it's not. The element won't be included in the page's tab sequence by default, making it inaccessible using a keyboard. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
* If the element should act as a link, add an `href` attribute that points to itself (<a href="#">) 
* If the element is not meant to be a link, change it to something more appropriate, like a button

                            Summary: Elements that can be interacted with, such as buttons, links, and input fields, must have an accessible name. The name should indicate which information or action is required, and/or what will happen if they interact with it.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element does not have an accessible name to inform the screen reader of its purpose and function.
**Effect:** 
Assistive technologies use the accessible name to label, announce and trigger the element's action. If there's no valid accessible name, assistive technologies won't be able to understand the element correctly. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Depending on the type of element, either add a descriptive text to the body of the tag or add the appropriate attributes to the tag.

                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element is missing the right tags or has incorrect tags. 
**Effect:** 
The element is excluded from the keyboard tab sequence and is therefore inaccessible to keyboard users. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use one of these approaches: 
* Approach 1 (recommended): Add a tag that shows the element's purpose. Interactive elements don't need anything extra because they are focusable by nature. 
* Approach 2: Add a `tabindex` attribute with the value of `0` to the element.

                            Severity: Critical
                            Summary: Keyboard users must be able to navigate to all the interactive elements on the page.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element is missing the right tags or has incorrect tags. 
**Effect:** 
The element is excluded from the keyboard tab sequence and is therefore inaccessible to keyboard users. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use one of these approaches: 
* Approach 1 (recommended): Add a tag that shows the element's purpose. Interactive elements don't need anything extra because they are focusable by nature. 
* Approach 2: Add a `tabindex` attribute with the value of `0` to the element.

                            Description: **Cause:**

                            Summary: Anchor elements (<a>) must have an `href` attribute to be recognized as a link.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
 The <a> (anchor) element does not have an `href` attribute. 
**Effect:** 
Screen readers on Windows will read the element as plain text without indicating it is a link. On Mac OS, VoiceOver will still read the anchor as a link, even if it's not. The element won't be included in the page's tab sequence by default, making it inaccessible using a keyboard. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
* If the element should act as a link, add an `href` attribute that points to itself (<a href="#">) 
* If the element is not meant to be a link, change it to something more appropriate, like a button

The element does not have an accessible name to inform the screen reader of its purpose and function.
**Effect:** 
Assistive technologies use the accessible name to label, announce and trigger the element's action. If there's no valid accessible name, assistive technologies won't be able to understand the element correctly. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Depending on the type of element, either add a descriptive text to the body of the tag or add the appropriate attributes to the tag.

                            Severity: Critical
                            Summary: Interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and inputs, must convey that they can be interacted with by using the proper semantics.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
Screen readers are unable to identify that the element is interactive due to missing or incorrect semantics.
**Effect:** 
Screen reader users may not find the content or may not realize that the the content is interactive.
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use native HTML interactive elements such as <*button*>, <*a*>, <*select*>, <*input*>. Alternatively, add the appropriate ARIA role that corresponds to the content purpose.

                            Severity: Critical
                            Summary: Anchor elements (<a>) must have an `href` attribute to be recognized as a link.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
 The <a> (anchor) element does not have an `href` attribute. 
**Effect:** 
Screen readers on Windows will read the element as plain text without indicating it is a link. On Mac OS, VoiceOver will still read the anchor as a link, even if it's not. The element won't be included in the page's tab sequence by default, making it inaccessible using a keyboard. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
* If the element should act as a link, add an `href` attribute that points to itself (<a href="#">) 
* If the element is not meant to be a link, change it to something more appropriate, like a button

The element does not have an accessible name to inform the screen reader of its purpose and function.
**Effect:** 
Assistive technologies use the accessible name to label, announce and trigger the element's action. If there's no valid accessible name, assistive technologies won't be able to understand the element correctly. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Depending on the type of element, either add a descriptive text to the body of the tag or add the appropriate attributes to the tag.

                            Severity: Critical
                            Summary: Interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and inputs, must convey that they can be interacted with by using the proper semantics.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
Screen readers are unable to identify that the element is interactive due to missing or incorrect semantics.
**Effect:** 
Screen reader users may not find the content or may not realize that the the content is interactive.
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use native HTML interactive elements such as <*button*>, <*a*>, <*select*>, <*input*>. Alternatively, add the appropriate ARIA role that corresponds to the content purpose.

2025-12-08T15:17:43.248Z [default] [info]: [Evinced Issue] Elements that can be interacted with, such as buttons, links, and input fields, must have an accessible name. The name should indicate which information or action is required, and/or what will happen if they interact with it.:

                            Summary: Elements that can be interacted with, such as buttons, links, and input fields, must have an accessible name. The name should indicate which information or action is required, and/or what will happen if they interact with it.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element does not have an accessible name to inform the screen reader of its purpose and function.
**Effect:** 
Assistive technologies use the accessible name to label, announce and trigger the element's action. If there's no valid accessible name, assistive technologies won't be able to understand the element correctly. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Depending on the type of element, either add a descriptive text to the body of the tag or add the appropriate attributes to the tag.

                            Severity: Critical
                            Summary: Keyboard users must be able to navigate to all the interactive elements on the page.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element is missing the right tags or has incorrect tags. 
**Effect:** 
The element is excluded from the keyboard tab sequence and is therefore inaccessible to keyboard users. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use one of these approaches: 
* Approach 1 (recommended): Add a tag that shows the element's purpose. Interactive elements don't need anything extra because they are focusable by nature. 
* Approach 2: Add a `tabindex` attribute with the value of `0` to the element.
