                            Description: **Cause:** 
The element is missing the right tags or has incorrect tags. 
**Effect:** 
The element is excluded from the keyboard tab sequence and is therefore inaccessible to keyboard users. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
Use one of these approaches: 
* Approach 1 (recommended): Add a tag that shows the element's purpose. Interactive elements don't need anything extra because they are focusable by nature. 
* Approach 2: Add a `tabindex` attribute with the value of `0` to the element.

                            Summary: Anchor elements (<a>) must have an `href` attribute to be recognized as a link.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
 The <a> (anchor) element does not have an `href` attribute. 
**Effect:** 
Screen readers on Windows will read the element as plain text without indicating it is a link. On Mac OS, VoiceOver will still read the anchor as a link, even if it's not. The element won't be included in the page's tab sequence by default, making it inaccessible using a keyboard. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
* If the element should act as a link, add an `href` attribute that points to itself (<a href="#">) 
* If the element is not meant to be a lin

* Approach 1 (recommended): Add a tag that shows the element's purpose. Interactive elements don't need anything extra because they are focusable by nature. 
* Approach 2: Add a `tabindex` attribute with the value of `0` to the element.

                            Summary: Anchor elements (<a>) must have an `href` attribute to be recognized as a link.
                            Description: **Cause:** 
 The <a> (anchor) element does not have an `href` attribute. 
**Effect:** 
Screen readers on Windows will read the element as plain text without indicating it is a link. On Mac OS, VoiceOver will still read the anchor as a link, even if it's not. The element won't be included in the page's tab sequence by default, making it inaccessible using a keyboard. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
* If the element should act as a link, add an `href` attribute that points to itself (<a href="#">) 
* If the element is not meant to be a lin

                            Description: **Cause:** 
 The <a> (anchor) element does not have an `href` attribute. 
**Effect:** 
Screen readers on Windows will read the element as plain text without indicating it is a link. On Mac OS, VoiceOver will still read the anchor as a link, even if it's not. The element won't be included in the page's tab sequence by default, making it inaccessible using a keyboard. 
**Suggested Solutions:**
* If the element should act as a link, add an `href` attribute that points to itself (<a href="#">) 
* If the element is not meant to be a lin
